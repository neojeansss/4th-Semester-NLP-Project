This is a project from my 4th semester course: Natural Language Processing

Purpose: 
The Model can detect hate speech from indonesian tweets. The datasets used in this project are:
1. data.csv: contains the indonesian tweets as well as the labels for hate speech and its categories
2. abusive.csv: contains the indonesian abusive words
3. new_kamusalay.csv: contains informal words in indonesian and has the meaning of them

The project uses jupyter notebook and uses libraries from NLTK, sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and wordcloud. This project was made in Google Colab (hence the drive import).
